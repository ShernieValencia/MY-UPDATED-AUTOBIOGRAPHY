 <section> <a style="color: #3d211a; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><p>I would like to express my journey from my past, In which my story is not that extraordinary but for me one person's story is gold. My name is Shernie Grace M. Valencia and was born at Manila on September 1, 2007. I grew up healthy as an only child. Which means I grew up with no siblings. Both my parents are kind and hardworking to the point that they would do their best to buy all of the things I want. Back then when I was younger my parents enrolled me to a international school at manila. I studied for tons of yrs at Elizabeth Seton School that thought me many lessons and joined more than 10 sports right back when I was younger up until I grew. I wasn't that smart back then but I was more on being an multiathlete. I started joining swimming competitions till I got an invite of joining water polo competition in our school. <br> <br> <br> If your reading this and you may ask that if I won or not? Well yes I won swimming but only got to have in the 3rd place and for water polo I won the 2nd place which I made my parents proud. That were my first competitions that I've joined. After a couple of months I joined in a different level of sports which is track n' field. Here the people told me that since I am active in swimming which requires speed then why not join track n' field instead. My parents accepted it and I joined in my first running competition and surprisingly won the 1st place which that was my first golden medal as an athlete when I younger. <br> <br> <br> In our school we have different kinds of sports up until the intramurals event came. While I was still young I kept on joining and joining all of the sports that I can and started playing dodgeball and badminton. One sport that hit me insane is when my classmates told my teacher to let me join in volleyball. At that time I was so shocked to the point that I was thinking if I'll go for it or not since I don't really know how to play volleyball that time and I was very nervous since it is not just for fun but it is also a competition for our intramurals and thinking is that I will be competing with higher levels that will require me a lot of effort although I've joined tons of other sports having volleyball in my mind was making me overthink a lot. Later that night my mind was full of what if's. What if my opponent hits me at the face just because of spiking hardly. What if when I get to serve the ball it will just go out. That night thoughts were in my mind. At the day of our intramurals which 2nd day was the volleyball game made me very very nervous. It took a lot of effort to see if which team will win. At the end surprisingly we got in 2nd place that was one of the most memorable times that I've had during my junior high school days. <br> <br> <br> Everything was doing fine when I was younger not until when I was in my 9th grade. One day when I was just sleeping and suddenly heared my mom screaming loudly like it was my first time hearing her scream that loud and crying. Suddenly I woke up and asked my mom what happened and shouted at me while crying and said that my dad passed away already for 2 days and just found out that day. That day had me my downs and didn't know what to do because my dad is the best one that I could ever have, no one else. I started to get depressed for the happenings that me and my mom had and didn't know what else to do. Those times in the year 2020 had me very down because I just lost the only 2 men in our family in just a year. My dad and my grandfather which made me thinking that I've got to do something. Long story short when I finished 9th grade I starting finding work to help my mom with our needs and tried to work at a marketplace which was owned by our neighbor. That time my closest cousin was with us which she also thought of applying a job as a call center right after she graduated senior high school and took the opportunity right after she was 18th years old white I was just around 14. Those days were the hardest times for us since my mom didn't have any work. It was all on us. <br> <br> <br> Those times had me a lot of lessons and as months passed by my mom chose that I should go study in Cebu, since I have a lot of cousins that will help me with my studies. Turning 10th grade I started traveling alone at the day of my birthday when I was 14 and had to be on my own. Started enrolling at the school of my aunt all my myself. After 2 months of studying my mom surprised me not knowing that she traveled from Manila to Cebu just to be with me and I woke up seeing her beside me. That day made me soo happy and gave me a big relief. After years passed by I continued joining in multiple events which made me continue my journey in continuing to strive more and doing the things that are right. From the past that I've experience I realized that every happenings in life has a reason on it which will make us to learn more new lesson that will come in our life.</p> <hr> </a> </section>
